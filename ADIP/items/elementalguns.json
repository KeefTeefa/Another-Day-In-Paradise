This one has been somehow half-built into another world, and has taken on life from that world. It is definitely a creature of some kind, sputtering a foul alien smoke and hissing violently as ultra-hot air escapes it's 'mouth.' The curls of smoke spiral into the air around it, the creature's breathing strained by the sheer heat in it's body.",

It's lightweight with a quick self-deploying bipod, has an expanded handguard system to allow for a forward grip, uses magnetic chambers to speed up reloading, and a biometric scanner allows the firing rate to be changed at the wielder's will. The externally driven action means this is much less likely to jam, and a prototype tesla coil design recycles electrical energy into each shot fired.",
