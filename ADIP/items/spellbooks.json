    "description": "A small leatherbound book that has been scorched almost unrecognizably. You quickly realize that it's made entirely out of flesh, which for some reason still reacts to stimuli. You hope it isn't still alive. The pages inside are filled with manic writing, at least it's only half written in an alien language. The pieces you do understand seem to point towards the book being used to log experiments on migos in order to better hunt them, at the sake of the author's sanity. The author's experimentation on the aliens has actually led to some interesting research. It appears the mi-go has an innate ability to reduce it's temperature to near nothing, and the author has reverse engineered this innate ability to an extent. The author claims it has some effect on mutational abilities.",
